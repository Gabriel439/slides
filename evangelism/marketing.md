% How to market Haskell

# Source material

This talk draws inspiration from the following book:

* [Crossing the Chasm: Marketing and Selling High-Tech Products to Mainstream Customers](https://www.amazon.com/Crossing-Chasm-Marketing-High-Tech-Mainstream/dp/0060517123)

The book addressed startups, but the advice is highly relevant to Haskell

I will substantiate the book's message with my own experiences promoting Haskell

# Who needs to hear this?

You are my target audience if you:

* … wish there were more Haskell jobs
* … wonder why Haskell fails to gain mainstream traction

You are not my target audience if you:

* … were hoping for a technical presentation with code
* … have given up hope on Haskell becoming mainstream

# Question for the audience

How would you know when Haskell had gone mainstream?

# Overview

* What is "marketing"?

# Everything you know about marketing is wrong

I'm confident my audience doesn't know how to market to mainstream programmers

Why?  People wouldn't be using Haskell in the first place
Even people who think they do probably don't

# Ideas

* How would you even know if Haskell were mainstream?
* Why did Rust succeed much more quickly than Haskell?
* Crib ideas from podcast discussion

# TODO

* Use something other than `pandoc` to render the slides
