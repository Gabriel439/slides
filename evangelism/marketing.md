% How to market Haskell

# Source material

This talk draws inspiration from the following book:

* [Crossing the Chasm: Marketing and Selling High-Tech Products to Mainstream Customers](https://www.amazon.com/Crossing-Chasm-Marketing-High-Tech-Mainstream/dp/0060517123)

The book addressed startups, but the advice is highly relevant to Haskell

I will substantiate the book's message with my own experiences promoting Haskell

# Who needs to hear this?

You are my target audience if you:

* … wish there were more Haskell jobs
* … wonder why Haskell fails to gain mainstream traction

You are not my target audience if you:

* … were hoping for a technical presentation with code
* … have given up hope on Haskell becoming mainstream

# Question for the audience

How would you know when Haskell had gone mainstream?

# Overview

* What is "marketing"?

# Everything you know about marketing is wrong

This is my one 🔥inflammatory🔥 slide for the talk

I'm confident that most of my audience (yes, you!) doesn't know how to market
Haskell to mainstream programmers

In fact, I'll wager that you misunderstand marketing _in general_

I'll go through a few marketing misconceptions, using MongoDB as the "foil"

(Sorry, MongoDB)

# Misconception #1: Marketing = Deception

Do you believe that popular tools thrive because of __misleading claims__?

🤔: Which database I should select for my business?

😎: I recommend MongoDB, the only database that is ✨web scale✨

People who believe this will conclude:

🤓💭 "I will steer conversations away from Haskell's poor IDE support"

# Misconception #2: Marketing = Hype

Do you believe that popular tools thrive because of __hype__?

🤔: How will I know which database is the best?

😎: All the ❄️cool❄️ kids are using MongoDB.  #JoinTheConvo

People who believe this will conclude:

🤓💭 "I should spend more time cheerleading about Haskell on social media"

# Misconception #3: Marketing = Paid promotion

Do you believe that popular tools thrive because of __corporate backing__?

🤔: Maybe I should just use Postgres instead?

😎: MongoDB just raised $150 million 💰.  If you can't beat 'em, join 'em

People who believe this will conclude:

🤓💭 "Facebook adopting Haskell will save the language"

# So what is marketing?

There is a kernel of truth to each misconception, but they each miss the point

The book "Crossing the Chasm" provides an excellent definition of "marketing":

> "Marketing" is prioritizing the needs of a "market".  A "market" is a
> group of users that reference each other when making decisions.

The key concepts are:

* Prioritization: Marketing is about what you choose __not to do__

* Self-referencing groups: Marketing is about who you choose __not to convince__

In other words, marketing is the art of saying "no", either to potential
projects or potential users

# Ideas

* Why did Rust succeed much more quickly than Haskell?
* Crib ideas from podcast discussion
* Critique "Simple Haskell" movement

# TODO

* Use something other than `pandoc` to render the slides
